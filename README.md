BitBadge is a creative reflow soldering badge. Designed by http://www.gaudi.ch

### Instructions

Place topleds on the grid to make your very own design.

![](https://github.com/sgmk//BitBadge-2022/raw/master/HandOuts/BitBadge_drafting.jpg)

Draft different designs with the empty canvas. Start with single colour and go beyond later. 

Download a .pdf HandOut for drafting:
https://github.com/sgmk/BitBadge-2022/blob/master/HandOuts/BitBadge_drafting.pdf

Or use the amazing online tool made by Bernhard: https://bernhardwagner.net/sgmk/bitbadge.html

The LEDs have a direction! Look for the little corner the is angled.
Make sure all the LEDs point towards the same direction.

Download and print the .pdf HandOut: 
https://github.com/sgmk/BitBadge-2022/blob/master/HandOuts/BitBadge_handout.pdf

The super switch can invert polarity. So both direction will be good. And for super advanced effects you can put 2 different colours in different direction and switch to choose which ones are lit. Or use external powers and switching for blinkeshit!
