### BitBadge

BitBadge is a creative reflow soldering badge.
Designed by http://www.gaudi.ch

### Instructions

Place topleds on the grid to make your very own design.



Draft different designs with the empty canvas. Start with single colour and go beyond later.

The LEDs have a direction! Look for the little corner the is angled.
Make sure all the LEDs point towards the same direction.

The super switch can invert polarity. So both direction will be good. And for super advanced effects you can put 2 different colours in different direction and switch to choose which ones are lit. Or use external powers and switching for blinkeshit!
